    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** It states that a class should only focus on one task or purpose. If a class mixes multiple responsibilities, any change in one feature might accidentally affect others. This also creates hidden dependencies between features, making the class harder to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Following this principle improves maintainability, makes testing simpler, and reduces the risk of unexpected bugs. It also helps teams scale because responsibilities are clearly separated and easier to work on independently.\n",
