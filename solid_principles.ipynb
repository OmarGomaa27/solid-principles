    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** It states that a class should only focus on one task or purpose. If a class mixes multiple responsibilities, any change in one feature might accidentally affect others. This also creates hidden dependencies between features, making the class harder to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Following this principle improves maintainability, makes testing simpler, and reduces the risk of unexpected bugs. It also helps teams scale because responsibilities are clearly separated and easier to work on independently.\n",

    "- The class above mixes tasks: creating orders, processing payments, updating inventory, and emailing receipts.\n",
    "- If at some point we change how payments work, it could accidentally affect how inventory management or emails work.\n",
    "- Testing also becomes needlessly complicated and difficult, as we would have to test each responsibility inside the same class.\n",
    "- Maintaining the code in a team is inconvenient, since team members would have to work on the same class for unrelated tasks.\n",
